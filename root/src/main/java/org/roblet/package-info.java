/**
 * This package contains definitions essential to the roblet world.

<P>
    Roblets are used in distributed applications.
    Such applications have components running on different network components.
    To make it work a couple of definitions are necessary
    that need to be the same in all such distributed components.
    And the most visible to the developer can be found here.
</P>

<P>
    This package defines {@code interface} classes only.
    They are implemented as part of the roblet libraries
    or need to be implemented by using applications
    or functionality providers.
    The central definition and a good point to start reading
    is the {@link Roblet}.
