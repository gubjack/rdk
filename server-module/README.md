# Library roblet-server-module

This library contains definitions needed when writing roblet server modules.
Such modules provide implementations of units.
They will be loaded by a server to allow instances of such implementations
to be provided to roblets.

You usually **do not include** when working with roblets.
Only if you write a roblet server module this library is of value.
